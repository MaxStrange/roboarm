# RoboArm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MaxStrange/roboarm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MaxStrange/roboarm)

Just a simple project for controlling a small Robot Arm in Rust and Arduino.

You need libudev-dev and pkg-config on Linux for this to work. I think it just works on Windows.
