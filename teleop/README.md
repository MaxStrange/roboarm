Robot Arm Manipulation with Rust

This program is for a class in my Master's Program at UW Bothell. The purpose is twofold:

1. To provide a project in which I can learn Rust
1. To control a small robot arm

## To Use

```rust
cargo build
cargo run
```

Install any dependencies that you don't have.
